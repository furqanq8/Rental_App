# Azmat Rental Fleet Management

This project contains a responsive, client-side web application for Azmat's rental fleet operations. It lets the team capture fleet, driver, trip, invoice, and supplier payment information while keeping a live overview of billing and payables status.

## Features

- **Unified dashboards** for fleet inventory, driver roster, trip log, customer invoicing, and supplier payments.
- **Mobile-first layout** with card shortcuts, touch-friendly tables, and responsive modals.
- **Data persistence in the browser** using `localStorage` so entries remain between sessions on the same device.
- **Excel export** powered by [SheetJS](https://sheetjs.com/) to download all registers as a multi-sheet workbook.
- **Invoice PDF generation** using [jsPDF](https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF) so customer invoices can be printed or emailed.
- **Finance reports** summarizing invoice collections and supplier payable status at a glance.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari).
2. Use the cards at the top of the page to add new fleet units, drivers, trips, customer invoices, or supplier payments.
3. Filter fleet, invoice, and supplier tables using the dropdown filters.
4. Click **Export All Data** to download the complete dataset as an Excel workbook.
5. Use the **Print PDF** button in the invoice table to generate a customer-ready PDF.

> ⚠️ All records are stored in the browser's `localStorage`. Clearing the browser storage or using a different browser/device will reset the data.

## Development Notes

The application is built as a static site with vanilla JavaScript and relies on CDN-hosted libraries for Excel and PDF capabilities. No additional build tooling is required.

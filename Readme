# Azmat Rental Fleet Management

This project contains a responsive web application for Azmat's rental fleet operations. It lets the team capture fleet, driver,
trip, invoice, and supplier payment information while keeping a live overview of billing and payables status. The UI remains a
lightweight vanilla-JavaScript experience, and the bundled Node server now persists data to a JSON file so records stay synced
across browsers without requiring any third-party npm packages.

This project contains a responsive web application for Azmat's rental fleet operations. It lets the team capture fleet, driver, trip, invoice, and supplier payment information while keeping a live overview of billing and payables status. The UI is still a lightweight vanilla-JavaScript experience, but it now persists data in a SQLite database through an Express API so the records are available from any device.

## Features

- **Unified dashboards** for fleet inventory, driver roster, trip log, customer invoicing, and supplier payments.
- **Mobile-first layout** with card shortcuts, touch-friendly tables, and responsive modals.
- **File-backed persistence** through a minimalist Node API layer that stores application state on disk for cross-device access.
- **Secure sign-in** gate that requires an administrator username/password before any fleet data is visible or synchronized.
- **Excel export** powered by [SheetJS](https://sheetjs.com/) to download all registers as a multi-sheet workbook.
- **Invoice PDF generation** using [jsPDF](https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF) so customer invoices can be printed or emailed.
- **Finance reports** summarizing invoice collections and supplier payable status at a glance.
- **One-click dark theme** toggle for the business dashboard so night-time operations stay comfortable on the eyes.

## Architecture Overview

- **Frontend:** `index.html` plus `assets/` static files served by the Node server. State is fetched from `/api/state` and synced
  back after every change.
- **Backend:** `server/index.js` runs a dependency-free HTTP server with in-memory session authentication, optional CORS, and JSON
  parsing. It exposes `/api/login`, `/api/logout`, `/api/session`, `/api/state`, and `/api/health` endpoints.
- **Persistence:** `server/storage.js` writes the serialized application state to `data/azmat-state.json` (configurable through
  `DATABASE_PATH`). The file is created automatically on first run.
- **Data persistence in the browser** using `localStorage` so entries remain between sessions on the same device.
- **Database-backed persistence** through a Node/Express API layer with SQLite storage so records survive browser refreshes and device changes.
- **Excel export** powered by [SheetJS](https://sheetjs.com/) to download all registers as a multi-sheet workbook.
- **Invoice PDF generation** using [jsPDF](https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF) so customer invoices can be printed or emailed.
- **Finance reports** summarizing invoice collections and supplier payable status at a glance.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari).
2. Use the cards at the top of the page to add new fleet units, drivers, trips, customer invoices, or supplier payments.
3. Filter fleet, invoice, and supplier tables using the dropdown filters.
4. Click **Export All Data** to download the complete dataset as an Excel workbook.
5. Use the **Print PDF** button in the invoice table to generate a customer-ready PDF.

> ⚠️ All records are stored in the browser's `localStorage`. Clearing the browser storage or using a different browser/device will reset the data.

## Development Notes

The application is built as a static site with vanilla JavaScript and relies on CDN-hosted libraries for Excel and PDF capabilities. No additional build tooling is required.
## Architecture Overview

- **Frontend:** `index.html` plus `assets/` static files served by the Express app. State is fetched from `/api/state` and synced back after every change.
- **Backend:** `server/index.js` runs an Express server with CORS support, JSON parsing, and logging. It exposes `/api/state` and `/api/health` endpoints.
- **Database:** `server/storage.js` manages a SQLite file (default `data/azmat.sqlite3`) containing the serialized application state. The file is created automatically on first run.

## Local Development

1. Install [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/) on your machine.
2. Copy the environment template if you want to override defaults:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Start the server (no `npm install` required):
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).

The Node server serves the static frontend and handles API requests in the same origin, so you can use the application
immediately. Any records you enter will be written to `data/azmat-state.json` (or your configured path).

By default the development server starts with `admin` / `admin` credentials. Update `AZMAT_AUTH_USERNAME` and
`AZMAT_AUTH_PASSWORD` in a `.env` file to pick your own secrets.

## Troubleshooting Persistence

- **Seeing an "Unable to reach the Azmat data server" banner?** The UI falls back to browser storage when the API is unreachable.
  Make sure the Node server is running locally (`npm start`) or that your deployed API endpoint is online.
- **Need to log back in?** The app locks itself when the authentication token expires. Refresh the page to re-enter your
  credentials and continue syncing data.
- **Hosting the frontend separately?** Configure `window.__AZMAT_API_BASE__ = 'https://api.yourdomain.com'` (or set
  `data-api-base` on the `<html>` tag) so the app knows where to send `/api` requests, and add that domain to the backend
  `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.
- **Serving files directly from disk or another static server?** Without the API, each browser maintains isolated data in
  localStorage. Run the provided Node server so records persist in the shared JSON data file.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy the environment template if you want to override defaults:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).

The Express server serves the static frontend and handles API requests in the same origin, so you can use the application immediately. Any records you enter will be written to `data/azmat.sqlite3`.

## Deployment & Custom Domains

1. **Build an environment:** Provision a Node 18+ runtime on your preferred host (Render, Railway, Fly.io, Azure Web Apps, etc.).
2. **Upload the repo:** Push this repository to a Git provider and connect it to the hosting service. Configure the start command
   to `npm start`.
3. **Configure environment variables:**
   - `PORT` – optional port override supplied by your host.
   - `DATABASE_PATH` – optional absolute/relative path if you want the JSON state file in a different location or mounted volume.
   - `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` – comma separated list of domains allowed to call the API if you serve the frontend separately.
   - `AZMAT_AUTH_USERNAME` & `AZMAT_AUTH_PASSWORD` – credentials required to unlock the dashboard.
   - `SESSION_TTL_MS` – optional session lifetime override (default is 12 hours).
4. **Point your custom domain:** Create an A/AAAA or CNAME record from your registrar to the hosting provider's endpoint. Complete
   any SSL configuration your provider requires.
5. **(Optional) Separate frontend hosting:** If you host the static files elsewhere, set
   `window.__AZMAT_API_BASE__ = 'https://api.yourdomain.com';` before loading `assets/js/app.js` (or add
   `data-api-base="https://api.yourdomain.com"` to the `<html>` tag), and allow the frontend domain through `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.

Once deployed, opening your custom domain will serve the Azmat dashboard backed by the live JSON state file on the server. Backups
can be created by copying the state file on the host.

## Operations Notes

- The `/api/health` endpoint returns `{ status: 'ok', auth: 'enabled' }` for uptime monitoring.
- Call `/api/login` to exchange administrator credentials for a bearer token, `/api/session` to validate an existing token, and
  `/api/logout` to revoke it ahead of expiry.
- Since the server uses only Node built-ins, no package installation is required. You can redeploy quickly or run it in
  restricted environments where npm registry access is unavailable.
- All entities are stored within the single serialized state record. You can reset the app by deleting the JSON file defined by
  `DATABASE_PATH`.
2. **Upload the repo:** Push this repository to a Git provider and connect it to the hosting service. Configure the start command to `npm run start`.
3. **Configure environment variables:**
   - `PORT` – optional port override supplied by your host.
   - `DATABASE_PATH` – optional absolute/relative path if you want the SQLite file in a different location or mounted volume.
   - `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` – comma separated list of domains allowed to call the API if you serve the frontend separately.
4. **Point your custom domain:** Create an A/AAAA or CNAME record from your registrar to the hosting provider's endpoint. Complete any SSL configuration your provider requires.
5. **(Optional) Separate frontend hosting:** If you host the static files elsewhere, set `window.__AZMAT_API_BASE__ = 'https://api.yourdomain.com';` before loading `assets/js/app.js` (or add `data-api-base="https://api.yourdomain.com"` to the `<html>` tag), and allow the frontend domain through `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.

Once deployed, opening your custom domain will serve the Azmat dashboard backed by the live SQLite database on the server. Backups can be created by copying the database file on the host.

## Operations Notes

- The `/api/health` endpoint returns `{ status: 'ok' }` for uptime monitoring.
- Logs are emitted with `morgan` in the "tiny" format; integrate them with your platform's logging solution as needed.
- Database migrations are not required because all entities are stored within the single serialized state record. You can reset the app by deleting the SQLite file.
